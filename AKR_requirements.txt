# Excellent — you’re **very close** 🎯

# That specific error message:

# ```
# (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted... BadCredentials')
# ```

# means Gmail **rejected your login** — i.e., your `MAIL_USERNAME` or `MAIL_PASSWORD` is not valid *for SMTP access*.

# ---

# ## 💡 Why this happens

# Google **no longer allows** direct SMTP login with your normal Gmail password.

# Instead, you must use either:

# * ✅ **App Password** (recommended) — if you have **2-Step Verification enabled**, or
# * ⚠️ Allow “Less Secure Apps” (deprecated — no longer available for most accounts).

# ---

# ## ✅ Solution — Use a Gmail App Password

# Here’s how to do it safely and permanently:

# ### Step 1. Enable 2-Step Verification

# * Go to 👉 [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
# * Turn **ON** *2-Step Verification* (if not already enabled).

# ### Step 2. Create an App Password

# * Visit 👉 [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
# * You’ll be prompted to log in again.
# * Under **Select app**, choose **Mail**.
# * Under **Select device**, choose **Other (Custom name)** — e.g., type `FlaskApp`.
# * Click **Generate** — Google will show a **16-character password** (looks like `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`).

# ### Step 3. Update your `app.py` config

# In your app, update:

# ```python
# app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@gmail.com'
# app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop'  # your generated App Password (no spaces)
# ```

# ⚠️ Make sure you paste it **without spaces**.

# ---

# ### Step 4. Restart Flask

# Restart your Flask app and try again — it should now send emails successfully 🚀

# ---

# ### ✅ Optional: Verify SMTP settings

# Keep these:

# ```python
# app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.gmail.com'
# app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
# app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
# ```

# ---

# ### 🧠 Pro tip (for production)

# Never hardcode credentials. Instead, load them from environment variables:

# ```python
# import os
# app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.getenv("MAIL_USERNAME")
# app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.getenv("MAIL_PASSWORD")
# ```

# and set them in your `.env` file.

# ---

# If you’d like, I can show you how to send a **nice-looking HTML email** instead of plain text (with a “Join Meeting” button and clean layout).
# Would you like me to add that next?
